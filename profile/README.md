## KSE Data Science and Dev Hub

This is the home page on Github for the Data Science and Dev Hub at the [Kyiv School of Economics](https://kse.ua/) in Kyiv, Ukraine. 
The Data Science and Dev Hub provides support to internal KSE clients in data science and software development. Here, students with skills and interest in data science and software development work under faculty guidance to address needs of internal KSE clients and selected external partners. 

### Our Projects

We work on three types of projects.

First, we offer short-term data science support to internal KSE clients. In response to requests or at our own initiative, we leverage tools for data analysis and visualization to deliver actionable intelligence about KSE's operations to managers and other decision-makers. 

In [one current project](https://github.com/Kyiv-School-of-Economics/student-performance), we are examining data on student academic performance in different programs across multiple years. The goal is to identify correlates of student performance, with the aim of improving decisions on admissions, the award of scholarships, and the design of programs. 

Second, we develop code to automate, streamline, and improve internal KSE workflows and processes. 

Third, we provide support to selected governmental and not-for-profit partner organizations to develop software that advances the public welfare. 

We confine our work to short-term, limited projects. Large scale software development projects are outside of our scope.


### Our Commitments

Our work is informed by several commitments:

_Data privacy_: We are scrupulous about using processes that protect the confidentiality of all personally identifiable information (PII). Our preferred approach is organize work processes that assure we simply do not receive any data containing any sensitive PII. 

_Non-profit status_: Our only clients are internal to KSE, or are governmental or not-for-profit partner organizations for which we perform services on an unpaid, volunteer basis. We do not perform paid works for hire. Those who wish to support our work are warmly encouraged to donate to KSE's scholarship funds, which support the students who work in the Data Science and Dev Hub and in other vital roles at KSE.

_Open source_: We do not produce proprietary software. Except in unusual circumstances subject to specific negotiation, all code we deliver to clients is released to the public and covered by open source licenses.

### Join Us? Work With Us?

As part of our work, participating students receive improved training in data science, software development, and project management by working on and delivering actual projects and services.

Positions as Assistants in the KSE Data Science and Dev Hub are open to students currently enrolled at Kyiv School of Economics. We are looking for students who are comfortable with coding. Students must be able to work with substantial independence. 

Students working on data science projects should have previous experience coding in R. Prior experience with git, Github, RStudio, and Quarto/R Markdown is a big plus. 

Students who are expected to perform service work for KSE as a condition of their grant or scholarship support are eligible to apply the hours they work in the Data Science and Dev Hub towards their service obligations. Other students are welcome to apply to work with us on a volunteer basis.


We welcome and thank you for your support of the [Kyiv School of Economics](https://kse.ua/).

## Data Science and Dev Hub

For now, this Github Organization operates mainly as a vehicle for the KSE Data Science and Dev Hub. In the Data Science and Dev Hub, KSE students work under faculty guidance on projects that address three types of needs.

First, we offer short-term data science support to internal KSE clients. In response to requests, or at our own initiative, we bring tools of  with actionable intelligence about their operations, based on analysis and visualization of data. In [one current project](https://github.com/Kyiv-School-of-Economics/student-performance), we are examining data on student academic performance in different programs across multiple years. The goal is to identify correlates of student performance, with the aim of improving decisions on admissions, the award of scholarships, and the design of programs. In all work, we adhere to strict practices on data privacy: is performed 

Second, we develop code to automate, streamline, and improve internal KSE workflows and processes. 

Third, we provide support to selected governmental and not-for-profit partner organizations to develop software that advances the public welfare. 

As part of our work, participating students receive improved training in data science, software development, and project management by working on and delivering actual projects and services.

Our work is informed by several commitments:

_Data privacy_: We are scrupulous about using processes that protect the confidentiality of all personally identifiable information (PII). Our preferred approach is organize work processes that assure we simply do not receive any data containing any sensitive PII. 

_Non-profit status_: Our only clients are internal to KSE, or are governmental or not-for-profit partner organizations for which we perform services on an unpaid, volunteer basis. We do not perform paid works for hire. Those who wish to support our work are warmly encouraged to donate to KSE's scholarship funds, which support KSE students that work in the data science hub.

_Open source_: We do not produce proprietary software. Except in unusual circumstances subject to specific negotiation, all code we deliver to clients is released to the public and covered by open source licenses.

We welcome and thank you for your support of the [Kyiv School of Economics](https://kse.ua/).
